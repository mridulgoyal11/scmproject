The objective of creating a unit converter that converts temperature, currency, and mass with the help of GitHub and Git Bash is to provide a reliable tool that can be used to easily and accurately convert units in these categories. The project aims to make unit conversions more efficient and accessible for users, especially those who work with multiple unit systems.
The use of GitHub and Git Bash is to ensure version control and collaboration on the project. This allows for the tracking of changes made to the project, easy collaboration with other developers, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary. With version control, the project can be worked on simultaneously by multiple developers, with the ability to merge changes seamlessly.
The unit converter should be user-friendly, accurate, and capable of handling various input formats. The objective is to create a comprehensive and adaptable tool that can cater to the needs of users from different industries, including finance, engineering, and science. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to make unit conversion easy, fast, and accurate for users, while ensuring a streamlined and efficient development process through the use of Git tools.
